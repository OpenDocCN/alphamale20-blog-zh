我见过的最有趣的总统选举还在继续！是时候赌共和党获胜了。

首先，我要重复一下我之前说过的话，最早在 3 月 15 日(T1)之前，我们都不知道谁是初选的赢家。所以我不会为任何人“叫停”。像往常一样，我只是在打赌。

令人惊讶的是，根据我看到的所有数据，唐纳德·特朗普有 70%的机会赢得共和党提名。也许 80%，但我不愿意到那么高。还没有。

截至今天，以下是有利于川普的因素:

*   According to opinion polls, Trump has won almost every debate held by the Republican Party. I've never seen anything like this. Trump's outsider status and super-alpha demeanor resonated with angry Republicans, although he had plenty of negative influences. Even in the last debate where the robot Lu Biao actually rattled Trump, Trump *still* won the debate (according to the poll). He even won the debate because he made huge left-wing offensive remarks, such as we were tricked into the war and Bush didn't protect our safety (by the way, both statements are true). Every time he makes controversial remarks or slips of the tongue, his poll numbers either go up or stay the same. So far, he is immune to the common things that get traditional candidates into trouble.

*   Usually, the votes cast for an established candidate (Lu Biao) are artificially divided by ted cruz who remains in the election. Normally, Trump will face a very tough battle between himself and a man with all the elite support and votes. But because Cruz, a prostitute concerned by mental illness, won't quit, he sucked 40-50% of Lu Biao's votes from him, making it easier for Trump to win. At present, he has won far more delegates than any other candidate. Far from it. It doesn't matter much before Super Tuesday, but ...

*   Most importantly, on Super Tuesday tomorrow, Trump leads the polls in 8 of the 11 states that voted. Isn't it amazing? In most states, he not only leads, but also leads by double digits. If people like Mitt Romney, Jeb Bush or marco rubio have this status at this time, the whole mainstream media will announce the end of the election and all other candidates will withdraw from the election. But since the elites hate Trump, you can't hear these things, and the battle continues.

为什么我说的是 70%，而不是像很多激动的特朗普支持者说的 100%或 90%？因为我很客观。以下是目前不利于特朗普的因素，而且这些因素都不小:

虽然到目前为止他还没有被争议打倒，但这并不意味着他不能。特朗普有很多，我是说很多关于他最近和在遥远的过去说过和做过的事情的定时炸弹，一旦精英们开始挖掘他的过去并真正追捕他，这些炸弹可能会让他沉没。

*   [His unfavorable ratings are sky-high](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/trump_favorableunfavorable-5493.html) , surpassing (I believe) any presidential candidate in modern history. Some people like him, but many people hate him, including Republicans. He strongly appealed to the angry nationalist right-wing population, but as I have said many times, the United States is now a left-wing country, and this population is now a minority. By "left wing" I also mean many Republicans. It is ridiculous that modern Republicans support the concept of small government.

*   Things in ted cruz fluctuate in both directions. As soon as ted cruz quits the election (it is very likely that he will quit before Lu Biao), the robot Lu Biao's votes will immediately double, or nearly double, which makes him a threat to Trump in some ways, not now. If Lu Biao drops out of the race before Cruz, the situation is just the opposite.

*   Finally, as I've been saying, elites will do everything they can to stop Trump, including breaking rules and laws. So far, the elites have been wasting their time knocking down other candidates and supporting the biggest Betaman on earth (Jeb Bush). Now, in the last week or so, this sleeping giant has just started to direct the cannon at Trump. They have a long time to bring down Trump (until June! ). The elites won every presidential election in my life, and it was so easy that they couldn't be excluded.

我会重申，我不支持特朗普。他是一个威权主义者和一个民族主义者，这两者都是个人自由和小政府的对立面，而我更喜欢小政府。无论此时谁成为总统，包括特朗普，美国也是一艘无法修复的沉船。但是我承认让精英们落选是一件好事。

我喜欢娱乐！所有这些特朗普戏剧，伯尼，和蜥蜴女王...这是史上最大灾难秀的前排座位。乔治·卡林是对的。
