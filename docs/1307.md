# 直截了当地说出非单一性

A while back, commenter Nicolas made this comment:

> I’m currently making a strange experiment. Well, it’s strange for me, as I’m testing your stuff (going for young hotties on dating sites while being in my late 30s). But I made a move in the complete opposite of this post. On my dating profile, I made a little bit of blabla (nothing interesting, but I write well, so it’s ok to have it), but the core of it, the main paragraph states (roughly translated to english):
> 
> “首先，我是一夫多妻的。我生命中有两个女人，我对她们有感觉。所以吸吧一夫一妻制！”(非常近似的翻译)
> 
> 我的回复率降到了 5%(在我这个年龄的女性中为 0%)。但是有两个女生联系我，一开网口就表现出对一夫多妻制的兴趣(在法国没美国大)。一个人告诉我，她认为 MLTR 是某种理想的关系。另一个只是渴望一夫一妻制关系中的空气(在我看来，她真的应该把一夫多妻当成一种生活方式)。
> 
> 所以，马上声明我是多配偶的:
> 
> –让我更关注我想认识的女孩类型。在我看来他们的 ASD 更低，不那么专横，我认为戏剧性也降低了(至少，我知道我不会有嫉妒戏剧)。
> 
> –使我的个人资料非常独特。他们联系我是因为他们想了解一夫多妻制。我突然不是网站上的随机简介，我可能是唯一一个陈述我的多配偶生活方式的人(appart from OkCupid，我不认为许多约会网站允许你展示你的非单配偶生活方式，OkCupid 在法国并不太重要)。
> 
> –在我看来显示出了巨大的 OI。总是一件好事。
> 
> –消除恐惧:我并不渴望性，我清楚地表明我有感觉。这两个女孩在第一条信息中告诉我，他们对第一次约会性行为持开放态度…比我预期的要多(我也会尝试你的 2 次约会模式，即使我可能会对他们的模式感到惊讶)。

Also, a reader named Paul recently sent me this email:

> I’ve been reading your blog for a year or two and own several of your books. Thank you for sharing so many of your experiences. Congrats on making a business out of it!
> 
> 我 46 岁，离异，有两个年幼的孩子。今天我有四个 FB，他们都知道我有其他的关系。他们中的一些人知道细节。他们分别是 22 岁、26 岁、28 岁和 40 岁。
> 
> 根据你的建议，我对我的方法做了一点小小的改变。在和女人发生关系之前，我会和她们谈论非一夫一妻制。因为性几乎总是发生在第二次约会，所以总是在第一次约会或第二次约会开始时。对于我现在的两个 FB，26 岁和 28 岁，他们非常欣慰和兴奋，因为我是如此开放的思想，不会试图在性方面垄断他们。提前告诉他们是一件立竿见影的好事。在 40 分钟的时候有一个短暂的打嗝，然后一切继续进行，就好像从来没有讨论过一样。对于 22，这只是一个无关紧要的讨论，她完全不在乎。

I still remember all the trouble I had back in 2007 and 2008 trying to get women to have open / polyamorous / nonmonogamous relationships with me. No matter what I said, no matter what facts I presented about divorce rates, or people cheating, or the benefits of not being monogamous, or having women just go back and remember why their past monogamous relationships failed, none of that helped. They were adamant about monogamy, period. It was a huge uphill battle. There was so much resistance.
*“Oh no, you’re wrong! Not all guys cheat!”*
*“Oh no, you’re wrong! Once you fall in love with someone, really fall in love, you won’t ever want to have sex with anyone else.”*
*“Oh no, you’re wrong! Once you find the right person/guy/girl, long-term monogamy works great! You just have to find that person!”*
*“Oh no, you’re wrong! My aunt/uncle/co-worker did it!”*
I also said many years ago that as time went on, monogamy’s failure rates would continue to rise. This would *force* people to start considering nonmonogamy whether they wanted to or not. And I was right. As I already talked about [here](https://blackdragonblog.com/2017/05/15/dating-trends-ive-noticed-last-10-years/), it is now far easier to get women into verbalized nonmonogamous relationships today than it was just ten years ago.
Another factor I had not considered also helped this: technology. In an internet / smartphone / social media world, it’s become extremely difficult to cheat on your girlfriend / boyfriend / spouse and [never get caught](https://blackdragonblog.com/2016/03/07/when-men-cheat-they-usually-want-to-get-caught/). Back in the 1980s, when there were no cell phones, no internet, and barely any computers, cheating was easy as hell. Today, cheaters are getting caught in far larger numbers than ever before because of technology. Soon, technology will render it literally *impossible* to cheat, as I explained [here](https://blackdragonblog.com/2017/04/13/technology-sexual-monogamy-will-soon-impossible/).
Today, [divorce rates](https://blackdragonblog.com/2014/07/13/divorce-statistics/) have gotten so bad and [cheating has become so rampant](https://blackdragonblog.com/2016/08/15/often-people-cheat-real-stats/), and being able to hide your cheating has become so difficult, I don’t have to convince new women I meet of monogamy not working and of nonmonogamy at least being a viable option. If a woman ever balks at the concept of having an open or poly relationship, all I have to say is, “**Every** boyfriend you’ve ever had has cheated on you, right?”
Every time I’ve said this, the woman just looks at me with a blank stare for a second, then embarrassingly looks away. Seriously. Try this. It will work. It’s worked on tons of women in the last few years, including Pink Firefly.
My advice is, as always, to slowly move a “normal” (i.e. she’s only done monogamy) woman into the world of open or poly. This way, you can take almost any woman, regardless of her background, and move her into a nonmonogamous relationship with extremely high odds of success. I describe exactly how to do this in this book [here](http://www.haveopenrelationships.com). <however we="" are="" now="" slowly="" moving="" into="" an="" era="" where="" some="" women="" don="" need="" this="" kind="" of="" hand-holding.="" as="" nicolas="" and="" paul="" have="" pointed="" out="" many="" can="" simply="" be="" told="" right="" up="" front="" that="" you="" only="" do="" nonmonogamous="" relationships="" they="" may="" just="" go="" for="" it.="">Can you do this with all women? No. As you can see from Nicolas’ experience, his response rates dropped to near-zero when he declared this on his online dating profile, and that was in France where they are a lot less uptight about sex than in places like the USA or Canada.
You can also see from both Nicolas’ and Paul’s accounts that the women they were dealing with were young. Nicolas was only going after [VYW](https://blackdragonblog.com/glossary/#VYW) and Paul noted that the 22 year-old “didn’t care” while the 40 year-old had a “hiccup.” Yup. That's exactly how it works. The other two girls were well under the Age of Doom: age 33.
So, if you would like to experiment with violating a part of my system, and verbalize your nonmonogamous intentions right up front instead of avoiding any discussion about the relationship for 3-5 months like I typically recommend, you may do so, as long as you follow these parameters:
1\. You are not a beginner at this stuff. I can tell that both Nicolas and Paul were reasonably experienced with my frames and techniques. Blatantly verbalizing nonmonogamy right up front is something for guys who are at the intermediate or advanced levels only.
2\. You are extremely confident and outcome independent. Again, I can tell that both Nicolas and Paul are in this category, at least to a strong degree. They’re also older men; Nicolas being in his late 30s and Paul being 46.
3\. You focus solely on younger women, meaning women well under age 33\. VYW would be ideal. As always, the younger the woman, the lower [ASD](https://blackdragonblog.com/glossary/#VYW) she’ll have, thus the more likely early verbalization will work. As Paul said, women under the age of 23 are barely going to care. Women age 23-28 are going to care a little. Women age 29-32 are going to care, but may still be workable. Women age 33 or over are going to be near impossible. (The 40 year-old Paul describes is an exception to the rule, I promise.)
4\. You already have other women in the pipeline. You can’t do the thing some [de facto monogamous](https://blackdragonblog.com/2016/02/25/de-facto-monogamy/) men do where you tell the woman you’re not monogamous, and call her an “[MLTR](https://blackdragonblog.com/glossary/#MLTR)” or “[OLTR](https://blackdragonblog.com/glossary/#OLTR)” when in fact you're monogamous because she’s the only woman you've had sex with for at least several weeks. If you’re telling a woman you’re nonmonogamous, you’d better actually be nonmonogamous, which means you’re regularly putting your cock inside at least two different women on a regular basis. Note that both Nicolas and Paul were dating several women at a time, not just one or two.
If you fall into all four of the above parameters, and want to give early verbalization a shot as an experiment or test, please do so. If you don’t fall into the above four categories yet, wait until you do.
And yes, in several more years or decades, many or even most women will agree to this stuff right on the first date (or sooner!). But we’re not quite there yet.
