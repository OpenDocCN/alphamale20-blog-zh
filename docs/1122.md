# 为了最佳的约会效果，居住在城市的哪个部分是最好的？

> 原文：<https://alphamale20.com/2017/06/15/best-part-city-live-best-dating-effectiveness/>

今天我们将讨论生活方式设计和约会后勤的一个重要方面，这个方面几乎从来没有被谈论过。也就是说，在你的城市里，住在哪里对你的约会/关系生活和你生活的其他方面来说绝对是最好的结果。

这篇文章不是关于居住在什么类型的城市，或者居住在什么样的城市。然而，由于我知道这个问题将会出现，我将在谈及我的主要观点之前简要地谈一下这个问题。我以前说过，约会新女性并保持一个体面的 [FB 的](https://blackdragonblog.com/glossary/#FB)和 [MLTR 的](https://blackdragonblog.com/glossary/#MLTR)花名册需要一个男人生活在一个至少有一百万人口或更多的城市，而且城市越大越好。低于一百万，[男性至上的 2.0 生活方式](http://www.alphamalebook.com/)变得更加困难，但仍然可行。低于 40 万人，这几乎是不可能的，除非你非常有创造力，或者不介意定期开车几个小时去一个更大的城市，或者不介意在约会生活中投入更多的钱。(也许“农村 Alpha 2.0”是未来博客的一个好话题。嗯...)

就城市类型而言，我教授的生活方式适用于任何西方城市(美国、欧洲、加拿大、澳大利亚、南非、新西兰等)，以及大多数亚洲、俄罗斯和南美城市(尽管对一些更保守的亚洲城市做了一些修改)。

我不能保证除此之外的任何地区的城市，比如非洲、印度或中东。(无论如何，我不建议住在那些危险或反性的地区，除非是暂时的，或者你正在做一些不寻常的事情——但是——对你的使命是必要的。)

既然我们已经解决了这个问题，那就进入主题吧。在你的 100 多万人口的城市中，最适合居住的地方是。

我把一个城市分成以下几个区域。每个区域都有自己的利弊。

*   Urban core
*   Outer core
*   suburbs
*   outer suburbs
*   village
*   remote

我会一一描述，然后在文章最后给你推荐。

**城市核心**

这实际上是闹市区，意思是你住在闹市区的高层公寓里。

*   Advantages: It is extremely easy to approach women. Very suitable for night games, street games, online dating, and almost all other types of games.
*   Fun and exciting.
*   No need for a car; Everything is within walking distance, and public transportation covers the rest.

缺点

*   It's ridiculously expensive. It's not just the rent, it's just everything you spend money on. Living in the city center will consume a large part of your income (unless you live in an exceptionally cheap country). Another reason is the sky-high taxes. Urban residents pay the highest taxes in the world. Very small living space, unless you are super rich or you live in an exceptionally cheap city. You'd better get used to living in a very small apartment even if you have roommates.
*   A high amount of pressure. A large number of studies show that people living in the city center tend to have more stress, more health problems and shorter life span.
*   The air quality is poor. If you live in the city center for a long time, please pay attention to health problems.

**外核**

这是你肯定住在“城市”的时候，但不完全是在市中心。你就在大多数高层建筑所在的核心地带之外。你可能住在公寓里，但也可能住在老房子里。
优点:

*   Easy access to women. It's not as easy as downtown, but it's very close.
*   Fun and exciting, but far less stressful than living in the core area. This is a slightly quieter lifestyle, with a bit of suburban feeling.
*   Easy access to everything. However, you may still need a car (depending on the city).

缺点

*   Very expensive. Not as high as the core residents, but still very high. So is the sky-high tax.
*   High crime rate. Among all the areas described here, the crime rate in the peripheral core area is the highest. In most cities, people living in the outer core become "accustomed" to things like stealing, vandalizing and wandering.
*   The air quality is poor, almost as bad as the core.

**郊区**

这意味着你住在城外的郊区。你可能住在房子里，尽管郊区也有许多公寓楼。
优点:

*   A calm and relaxed lifestyle. This is a good place to raise children if you want.
*   The cost of living is still a little high, though not as high as that in the city. Taxes are usually low.
*   Decent, but not very touching with women. Not as good as in the city, traffic is a problem now, but the suburbs are still full of women.
*   It's fairly easy to get everything, although you *will* need to own a car.

缺点

*   Although technically speaking, living in the suburbs is not as expensive as living in the city, living in the suburbs has a very strong "comparison mentality", which often pushes up the cost of living for emotional reasons. When your next-door neighbor has a perfect yard, or a cool new boat, or a great barbecue, or parks in a great new truck, it's hard to say no to yourself for doing these things, even if you didn't want them in the first place. Women are especially absolute prisoners in this system, so if you live in the suburbs with a woman, you need to be very careful with your budget ... She will keep yelling at you to make you look like everyone else in the block.
*   There are far more children and teenagers in suburbs than in cities, which may irritate some people. If you need to go to town, you will see a real road with real traffic, which will take some time and gas. It's inconvenient to go to the city often.

**远郊**

这是郊区和农村地区之间的地带，距离市中心约 45 分钟车程。这就像郊区一样，除了一切都更分散。商店和娱乐场所离得更远，房屋之间的距离也更远，公寓楼也很少(即使有，也非常小)。
优点:

*   Very calm, peaceful and relaxed lifestyle, even more so than the suburbs. This is a good place to raise children if you want.
*   The cost of living is extremely low. You spent money on a lot of things. Compared with your partners who live in or near the city, you can live like a little king. Taxes are also low.

缺点

*   It's not easy for you to touch women anymore. Dating and relationships require some important transportation, logistics planning and budget. Distance logistics needs to be considered in a way that people near the city never need to worry about.
*   You are really far away from the city now; When you consider the traffic problem, that trip is a real short trip, and it usually takes up to an hour one way, so you'd better have a lifestyle that doesn't need to go to town often.

**农村**

这是一个远离郊区和远郊的区域，远离乡村，距离市中心一个小时甚至更远。像公寓楼、购物中心和餐馆这样的东西在这里是不存在的。你看到的只有土地，偶尔还有房子或农场。这里的房子往往又大又贵，而且通常离最近的邻居都有好几英亩远。住在这里的大多数人都是富人、退休人员和农民。
优点:

*   Super-calm, quiet and relaxed lifestyle.
*   An isolated lifestyle, usually with a large amount of land. Very suitable for introverts or people who love nature.
*   Essentially zero crime. People don't even lock the door when they go out because they don't need to.

缺点

*   A little expensive. Houses here are often nice, big and expensive. Even if you don't want to, you often have to buy land.
*   *Everything* is far away. Even buying groceries or watching movies means you have to stay in the car for a long time.
*   Women are essentially gone. The only few women around are married older women. T21 people have more right-wing or peasant attitudes, which may irritate some people.

**穷乡僻壤**

住在郊区的人离任何大城市都有两个小时甚至更远的路程。他们真的是在荒郊野外。他们要么住在大片廉价的土地上，要么聚集在非常非常小的城镇里。
优势:

*   Super cheap, by far the cheapest special zone. You can almost buy a big four-bedroom house for $30,000 or less. Even people with lower incomes can live an emperor's life in the countryside as long as they don't get into debt.
*   Super-calm, quiet and relaxed lifestyle.
*   An isolated lifestyle, usually with a large amount of land. Very suitable for introverts or people who love nature. Almost zero crime (although stupid, boring teenagers can sometimes be a minor problem).

缺点

*   Everything is not only far, but also *hours* away. Even grocery shopping means you have to stay in the car for a long time. Going to the city is a big event, and it's also what you do for your "holiday"
*   The women are basically gone. The only women around, a few, are older and married (and probably ugly). Even if you meet a rare sexy girl, she will move out of this area as soon as she turns 18\. The extreme right-wing/peasant attitude lives among a few people around you, which may irritate some people. Not a good place to raise children. There is not enough social interaction and there are not enough things for them to do. In remote areas, the proportion of teenage pregnancy and drug abuse is usually high. Unless you are a hermit, everyone in your area "cares about your affairs" and almost everyone knows all your personal information. The local gossip is rampant and is an accepted part of life.

**最佳居住区**

生活在“最佳”区域取决于你是什么样的人和你的目标。如果你是一个热衷于一夜情和分数的年轻的、追求刺激的 PUA 人，那么毫无疑问，你需要住在市中心或外围。一夫一妻制的男性家庭成员会想住在郊区(他的妻子也会，不管他愿不愿意，她可能会强迫他搬到那里)。 就我所说的[阿尔法男性 2.0 生活方式](http://www.alphamalebook.com/)而言，在那里，你通过一两个小型但有利可图的独立业务，每周以最少的小时数尽可能多的赚钱，在那里，你每月的税收和支出最小化，在那里，你与多个 FB 和/或 MLTR 约会(和/或也许还有一个 [OLTR](https://blackdragonblog.com/glossary/#OLTR) )，最适合居住的区域是*远郊*。第二个最好的选择是郊区或农村。第三个最好的，但不是最好的选择是外围核心(太贵了)，除非你是一个年轻的家伙，打算在未来的某个时候搬出那个区域。最糟糕的选择是核心区(太贵了)和偏远区(女人太少了)。如果你一年中只有几个月住在市中心或农村/偏远地区，这是个例外，我计划在 2025 年永久离开美国之前这样做。香港市中心是我在这个世界上最喜欢的城市，很可能是我一年中有几个月会去的地方。然而，我不会住在那里。太贵，压力太大(而且在香港，夏天又热又潮湿)。我可能会在那里待几个月，夏天的时候在美国待几个月去拜访我的朋友和家人，剩下的时间在像新西兰或阿根廷这样的远郊。

另一个可能的例外是有同居 OLTR 的老年人。这些人可能会住在农村或偏远地区，偶尔去离市区更近的地方，拜访一些普通的家庭旅馆。

更年轻的人更关注做爱，而不是赚钱，这可能暂时在核心或外围还好，只要你有一个具体的作战计划和未来的日期来离开那里，这样你就可以最大化你的收入，最小化你的债务，最小化你的税收和生活支出，最大化你的投资和储蓄。

今天，我住在远郊。我过去在郊区住了很多年，较高的消费和“攀比”让我发疯，所以几年前我搬到了远郊。这是我一生中最好的决定之一。我过得很好，在生活费用上花很少的钱，付很少的税，住在很好但很便宜的房子里，过着非常快乐、压力小的生活。

诚然，见女人是一个挑战，但这是我唯一的挑战，而且一点也不精彩。在我看来，阿尔法 2.0 *住在离市中心尽可能远的地方，以至于女人们会抱怨你住得太远，但是仍然会努力来看你*。这意味着你在做爱的同时还能在生活方式上省下一大笔钱。如果女人很高兴在你住的地方见到你，因为你离市中心很近，你在生活方式上花费了不必要的钱，至少在我看来是这样。

许多年来，自从搬到远郊后，女人们经常抱怨“我住得太远了”，但她们还是会开车到我家和我做爱。如果我住在农村或偏远地区，这种情况就不会发生。他们会用 GPS 定位我的地址，然后马上拒绝。

因此，远郊是低生活成本和接触女性之间的完美平衡。住得离城市近，你就浪费了钱，住得远，你就失去了接触女人的机会。如果 Alpha 2.0 是你想要的，我建议你设定一个目标，在未来的某个时候搬到这个区域，如果你还没有住在那里的话。

对于更冒险的 Alpha 2.0，你可以将它与[五旗目标](http://calebjonesblog.com/moving-out-of-the-country-part-1/)或类似的目标结合起来，或者当你离开西方世界时。住在一个便宜的非西方国家的远郊，你会节省大量的现金(你可以用来投资),同时仍然过着很好的生活。
