# 改变你的日常工作模式

我学到的最有价值的一件事是将我关于每天应该做多少工作以及应该什么时候做的错误观念分解开来。社会编程训练你相信“工作”是你在周一到周五早上 8 点到下午 5 点或 6 点之间做的事情。下班回家后，你应该停止工作。漫长的一天过后，你应该放松放松。此外，在周六和周日，你也应该避免工作，除非你不得不，而是花时间与家人放松。这个系统只有一个问题:糟透了。如果你加上通勤时间(普通美国人每天花 51 分钟在车上，上下班)，那么你很容易在一个典型的全职公司工作或业务中每周工作 50 或 60 小时。在办公室和车里长时间工作九个小时意味着你会感到疲劳、紧张、注意力不集中，即使有休息时间也是如此。即使你在办公室呆了八个小时，你也只能完成两三个小时的实际工作。更糟糕的是，你会开始认为工作是一个痛苦和折磨人的过程，而不是令人兴奋和有趣的事情。你将开始期待周末，这样你就可以“放松”了对不起，但是那听起来很可怕。我想如果你是一个极端类型的工作狂，这个时间表会很棒(祝你好运，不会在 65 岁前死于心脏病)。但是对于其他 90%的人来说，我认为有更好的方法。我做一些完全不同的事情。总的来说，我每天都工作，一周七天。然而，

*   I only work three or four hours a day. I know, because I always work with a timer or a stopwatch. Sometimes there are exceptions. I will work for five, six or more hours, but the normal situation is three to five hours.

*   My working hours are real working hours, not wasted working hours that I have to deal with like many office workers. Typical office workers finish two to three hours of work in an eight-hour working time. I finished three hours of work in three hours. I worked less than half the time, and I got at least as much **as I finished** . I can work whenever I want. For example, I may work for an hour in the morning, then go to the movies in the afternoon, then work for another hour or two, then go out at night, and then do it for another hour before going to bed. Or I might sit down, concentrate on working for four hours at once, and then take a day off. It depends on the day, my mood and what I am doing. The point is, I work when I want to work, not when it "should" be done based on some external (and unrelated) social standards. I can take a vacation whenever I want. No boss, customer or client told me when I was "allowed" to take a vacation. No. If I want to take a day off, I'll take a day off. Of course, I like to work, so I don't take too much time off. Even when I travel for pleasure, I usually work for a while. But, this is because I choose to do this, not because I have to. When you follow such a schedule, your whole view of work will change. Get rid of Fri mode from Monday to Friday, 8-5:
    *   You will never get tired of work. You will never be exhausted. You rarely feel nervous.
    *   Work is no longer a big headache monster, but a pleasant daily activity that you really look forward to. It becomes fun to do. If you are a freelancer (you may have to have such a schedule), it is easier to develop more disciplined work habits. If you do this every day instead of just five days a week, it will be easier to get into the habit. You can spend more time with your family and friends. You can spend more time on hobbies and/or fitness. The quality of life has improved in almost every aspect. As always, remember, just because society dictates that something should be done in the "right way" doesn't mean it's the best way.
