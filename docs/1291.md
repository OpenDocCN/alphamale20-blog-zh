Everything below is all 100% true to the best of my memory, journals, and spreadsheet records, though all the names of the people described have been changed.
We last left off ten years ago, in December 2008, where the chaos with my crazy 18 year-old [MLTR](https://blackdragonblog.com/glossary/#MLTR) continues…

*December 2008*
My insane relationship with Selina grinded onward. During this time I continued to also see Marci, who, as I have already mentioned in a prior installment, had recently returned to me. This meant I was seeing Selina as an MLTR, Marci as an FB, and then a smattering of other random women, most of whom I met through Selina, who was an extreme extrovert and had a massively large social circle.
When she wasn’t at my house, Selina would be hanging out with friends, going to parties, screwing other guys, and smoking weed. She did not have a job and did not drive. Instead, she had a beta male who had insane oneitis for her [who drove her around whenever she wanted](https://blackdragonblog.com/2014/11/30/beta-male-behaviors-avoid/). She would call him “her bitch,” which is pretty much what he was. Several times he would drive across town from 50 minutes away to my house, pick her up, drive her 10 minutes from my house, drop her off nearby, then drive 50 minutes all the way back home.
Ah, beta males.
At some point, and I don’t remember when, I very stupidly stopped using a condom on her. She had already had a kid who was being raised elsewhere and had a Merina IUD, so I figured it was okay. She also said she wasn’t having sex with anyone else, which I either believed or *wanted* to believe just to stop wearing the condom. Very, very stupid on my part. This would later come back to bite me in the ass, as you’ll see in a minute.
A few key people she introduced me to during this time who would factor into these stories either now or later: A) her mom, who was just two years older than me; a physically fit and attractive extreme [Dominant](https://blackdragonblog.com/2012/07/29/the-three-types-of-women/), B) her 16 year-old sister, who was even hotter than her, though obviously underage and off limits to me, C) one of her guy friends who I’ll call “Joe” who she said was gay (though he obviously wasn’t; I even said so at the time when she told me), D) one of her hot, blonde sister’s friends who was 19, and of course, E) Emi, who I talked about last time, though she moved to California a few weeks prior and was now out of my life.
Selina started pressuring me to let her move in with me. I knew there was no way in hell I could have someone with this insane a lifestyle live with me, no matter how much fun she was. I gently told her no.
A little later, we went to a local fashion show put on by one of my brothers. Selina had a little to drink, and on the way back home, told me she loved me for the first time. I forget what I said in response. I tried to be as nice and sweet as I could, but I didn’t say I love you back (because I didn’t love her; she was 18 years old for Christ’s sake).
When I didn’t reciprocate she started crying. I gave her a hug but that was all I could do. Later that night we had sex (a lot) and she kept screaming that she loved me. She left the next morning.
A few days later I was on MySpace (yes, this is back when MySpace was a big deal) sending out openers to new women. I hit Selina’s profile and saw that she had just changed her relationship status to “Married.”
Uh... what?
On her profile it said she had married the “gay” guy Joe.
Rolling my eyes, I sent her a text. The conversation pretty much went like this:
Me: So you’re married now?
Selina: Yep.
Me: Ok.
And that was that. Our relationship was over (or at least this phase of it). My first MLTR and my first extended relationship with a much younger woman ended when she married another guy while dating me. I just laughed. What a crazy life I was living.
A little later I would find out that Joe was in the Army and leaving for Iraq. As usual with these young military guys, he begged her to marry him so that he could get an instant raise (which is what happens in our insane military). He “loved” her and had been fucking her all along (of course) along with at least two other men I didn't know about (of course). He promised to put her up in her own apartment and have babies with her, both of which she craved. After me not letting her move in and not reciprocating her “love,” he was an attractive choice for her, so she agreed.
Around this same time, I tested positive for Chlamydia. Fun! She had given it to me of course, and later I found out she had given it to Joe and a few other guys as well. I was a **fucking idiot** for having sex with someone like this without a condom, even when I knew she was not very safe, despite what she said. Well, lesson learned. I took antibiotics for a week and quickly cured it with no symptoms, and it was the last STD I would ever have. (This was ten years ago, and I’m still clean.)
Marci stopped seeing me at around this time (she did not get the Chlamydia, thankfully), since she had also moved to California and was only seeing me now when she made business trips back up to my region. So now, shit, I had no one else consistent.
Hm. Another lesson learned.
**Lesson Number Twenty-Two**
**Two women on rotation is usually not enough. If you lose one, now you’re monogamous (YUCK!). If you lose both at around the same time, which is entirely possible, now you’re going without sex until you get back out there and find new women. If regular sex is important to you without having to go pick-up new women, you should consider *three* women on rotation as a forever minimum. I do.**
It still wasn't over. Just a few weeks later I discovered yet another disturbing development, this one possibly even worse than an STD. Selina had gotten pregnant from Joe.
Wait a minute. I thought she had an IUD? A few months later she would give me some kind of story about how the IUD got “dislodged” during sex with Joe (who had a big cock) and this somehow made her pregnant. Yeah. Right. What’s more likely is that she lied to me about having the IUD to begin with, and I was just lucky as hell to not have gotten her pregnant. I never discovered which was true.
Oh well. Another lesson learned.
**Lesson Number Twenty-Three**
**Just because a woman is cute, fun, and fantastic in bed doesn’t mean you should believe shit she says, nor does it mean you should take the condom off just because you’ve been having sex with her a while. This goes double if she’s under the age of 23\. You risk STDs and accidental pregnancies no matter what she says.**
As the Christmas season intensified, I decided to take a break from going after any new women and would instead relax for Christmas and hit the dating sites hard in January (which, little did I know at the time, is [the best month for online dating](https://blackdragonblog.com/2017/10/16/12-months-relate-dating-relationships/)).
Now that my schedule was cleared of women, and now that I had *much* more experience with women, armed with my new goal of having at least three women on rotation, when January 2^(nd) 2009 rolled around, I hit it hard, starting off 2009, my craziest woman year of all time…
More coming soon.
