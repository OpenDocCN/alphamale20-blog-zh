# 你如何利用中国/非洲的情况

> 原文:[https://alpha male 20 . com/2018/09/09/how-you-can-exploit-the-China-Africa-situation/](https://alphamale20.com/2018/09/09/how-you-can-exploit-the-china-africa-situation/)

Doug Casey recently [wrote an article](https://www.caseyresearch.com/doug-casey-on-chinas-exploitation-of-africa/) concerning China’s slow takeover of Africa, what that means for Africa, and what it might mean for you if you plan on doing business with Africans or the Chinese (which I think you should). First, he lays out the problems with Africa, and there are many:

> It’s important to remember that Africa doesn’t produce anything besides raw materials. There’s close to zero manufacturing, like 1% of the world’s total, in sub-Saharan Africa. And almost all of that is in South Africa. The little there is, is only produced with the help foreigners—Europeans, but increasingly the Chinese.
> 
> 非洲人没有欧洲人新教的职业道德。他们没有中国儒家的职业道德。
> 
> 首先，普通非洲人甚至不会存钱。非洲的每一种货币基本上都一文不值。即使你有钱存，你打算把它停在哪里？非洲的银行系统几乎不存在。银行不稳定，政府基本上是盗贼统治。
> 
> 非洲甚至不在考虑范围之内。这个大陆没有文明，没有经济，没有技术，没有军事力量。著名的津巴布韦废墟只是一些半成品的石头相互堆叠在一起——它们被认为是标志性的。
> 
> 管理这些非洲政府的人不会改变他们的种族和文化。
> 
> 非洲的方法多年来都是一样的。进入政府。能偷多少就偷多少。然后去欧洲过亿万富翁的生活。

These are among the many reasons why most of Africa *still* remains (mostly) a shithole even after centuries of human civilization. The Africans simply don’t want to be successful. They’d rather fight each other and steal each other’s stuff. I don’t like to say that, but facts are facts. If Africa wanted to be successful, they would be. The entire continent is rich with resources. Africa could have an empire the size of the USA or the riches of Saudi Arabia. But they don’t want these things, so they don’t.
But China, on the other hand, *does* want these things. And they’re going to get them. Much of that will be in Africa…

> they’re definitely exploiting Africa. We’re seeing a veritable re-colonization of Africa. Every time I visit Africa I see more and more Chinese. It doesn’t matter which country; they’re everywhere.
> 
> 中国人民如何看待非洲人？他们不重视他们。当然，你必须记住，中国从第一天起就认为自己是世界的中心。他们把所有非汉族人视为野蛮人，低人一等。18 世纪末，当英国派遣大使马戛尔尼(Macartney)开启两国关系时，这是绝对正确的。他受到了近乎蔑视的对待——就像自哥伦布时代以来欧洲人和美国人对待原始民族的方式一样。这实际上是人类的正常态度，当一种先进的文化遇到一种落后的文化。中国人认为他们的文化甚至优于西方，并且相信——可能是正确的——他们很快也会在经济和技术上更胜一筹。

Yup. While the USA wastes its time in the Middle East and [goes into debt](https://calebjonesblog.com/what-these-tax-cuts-mean-for-you/), and while Europe continues to suicide itself, China is wisely and quietly taking over the continent that will be the most important place in the next 50 years...

> Nonetheless, Africa is going to be the epicenter of what’s happening in the world for years to come. It’s gone from being just an empty space on the map in the 19th C, to a bunch of backwater colonies in the 20th C, to a bunch of failed states that people are only vaguely aware of today. Soon, however, it will be frontpage news.

> 八十年后，尼日利亚的拉各斯将成为世界上最大的城市。人口有望超过 9000 万。世界第二大城市将是刚果的金沙萨，人口约 8000 万。坦桑尼亚的达累斯萨拉姆将成为世界第三大城市，拥有大约 7500 万人口。

Reason number 247 that Western civilization is on its way out. Africans are out-breeding all other races, particularly and especially white people. What are small cities now in Africa will be huge, sprawling, mind-bogglingly large metropolises by the time I’m an old man (which isn't very long considering I'm 3.5 years away from turning 50). It will change everything.
The Collapsing West has no fucking idea of course, nor cares. But the Rising East knows this very well and is taking advantage of it.
It’s going to still be very hard in Africa though…

> Just look at what Zimbabwe recently went through. It forcibly evicted 250,000 Europeans, and stole almost all their property. There are only about 5,000 Europeans left there now. I was last there a couple of years ago. The place now produces nothing but people and political agitation. It used to be the breadbasket of Africa. Now it’s going back to bush.

> 你可能会认为南非人会说，“天哪，那个国家的经济完全被政治和嫉妒摧毁了。这不是一个好主意；我们应该采取更明智的行动。”
> 
> 但他们却反其道而行之。他们宣布了一项无偿没收所有白人土地的计划。几周前他们开始了两个游戏农场。一切都将分配给总统和他的部长们的亲信。然后，驱逐了两个白人部落——南非白人和英国人——剩下的九个黑人部落将开始争夺一切。
> 
> 这是为什么呢？是因为南非黑人就那么蠢吗？我想了想，答案是“不”。他们实际上认为津巴布韦发生的事情是成功的。
> 
> 黑人从拥有国家财富的 10%到现在拥有 99%。看起来很不错。财富的绝对数量下降了 75%这一事实与他们无关。
> 
> 这是看待事物的不同方式。南非没有黑人认为津巴布韦犯了一个错误。他们认为摆脱白人是一个胜利。
> 
> 这明显是种族歧视。但是非洲可能是这个星球上种族主义最严重的地方。大多数欧美人要么不知道这一点，要么即使知道，也永远不会承认。

Again, even though Africa will be a very important place in several decades, the Africans are going to have to deal with the biggest problem they’ve always had: themselves. No, not “European colonization” or Chinese or whatever.  Just like the problem in Europe is the suicidal Europeans and not the immigrants they’re hording in, the problem in Africa is the racist, irrational Africans hell-bent on keeping themselves in perpetual poverty.
Will these huge future African cities be shining cities on the hill like Hong Kong or Singapore? Or will they be expansive hellholes the likes of which we have never seen?
It’s up to the Africans. No one else.
The most interesting thing will be how China deals with all of this. Unlike the West, China isn’t politically correct and doesn’t take any crap…

> [African] governments really only know how to do one thing: steal. In Congo it’s likely to be more overt. In South Africa, they’re passing a law which mandates blacks must own 30% of the mining company’s shares, plus get a 1% royalty, plus be in the majority of management. And a lot more. I may be slightly off in the numbers, working from memory—but it’s going to destroy mining. These people are actually insane.
> 
> 从好的一面来看，由于中国在非洲有大量投资，他们不会让非洲政府没收他们的资产，把它们耗尽。
> 
> 如果贿赂政治领导人被证明是无效的，他们可能会把士兵的靴子放到地面上。他们可以派红军去保卫他们的财产。或者派刺客去干掉个别的非洲政客。

I’ve been thinking the exact same thing. If Africa rips off China, China isn’t going to just sit back and take it the way the USA does when North Korea rips it off or the way Europe takes it when it gets ripped off by Africa or the Middle East. Again, China isn’t interested in suicide like the West is. The Chinese don’t give a shit about being nice or fair. If Africa screws with China even a little bit, Africa is going to get bitch-slapped in ways they haven’t been for over 100 years.
Given all of this, is it still a good idea for young entrepreneurs to move to Africa and start their fortunes there? YES! When asked about this, Doug said:

> Absolutely. I know what I’ve been saying may sound contradictory.
> 
> 毕竟，如果非洲有可能在未来几十年陷入经济、政治和社会崩溃，又怎么会有机会呢？
> 
> 然而，机会很多，因为非洲的竞争环境非常不均衡。这正是你想要的。
> 
> 你不想要一个公平的竞争环境；你想要一个朝你方向倾斜的。如果一个年轻的美国人或欧洲人留在自己的国家，他就和其他 1 亿人一样。他没有边际优势。
> 
> 如果你去非洲，情况就不同了。你有很多边际优势。你可能是唯一一个有一定背景、技能、教育、资本和关系的人。你很自然地与众不同。这让事情变得更容易实现。
> 
> 在你到达现场的几个星期后，你可以和总统或者这个国家最富有的人坐下来。
> 
> 我认为这是一个来自欧洲或美国想要致富的人的绝佳去处。还有一次异国冒险作为奖励。

Exactly. If you’re a young guy and want to make a lot of money very fast, and don’t mind living in a semi-shithole for a few years, Africa is the place to go. Because:
1\. It's at the bottom; the only way it has to go is up. And as I’ve said, parts of Africa will get better. Slowly, but they will.
2\. You’ll have instant clout as a non-African, as Doug described. If you’re white, that’s even better, but even Asian /Hispanic / Indian guys will do well.
3\. The population growth is **exploding** over there, and will for at least the next 50 years. This is all kinds of good for business opportunities. No where else in the world is the population growing this fast.
4\. Geoarbitrage and everything else I talk about [in my book](http://www.alphamalebook.com/) about starting and maintaining an Alpha 2.0 location independent business applies to Africa.
If I was single, no kids, and in my 20s, I would go to Africa (SE Asia would be my second choice) to start a business. I would plan on staying there five years, make as much money as I could, set up some flags over there, then move somewhere else while maintaining my growing Africa income.
If you’re going to ask me about what kinds of businesses to start over there, read [this](https://calebjonesblog.com/business-opportunities-africa/).
Africa is definitely one of the places to watch over the next decade or two.
