# 在 2018 年自由音乐节上

> 原文：<https://alphamale20.com/2018/07/18/at-freedomfest-2018/>

I’m writing this while at the Freedomfest conference in Las Vegas. It’s the largest gathering of libertarian (or libertarian-leaning) folks in the world. Most of the sessions here focus on investing, business, and politics. As you might imagine, the political stuff doesn’t really interest me; I’m here for the investing and business materials, as well as to meet some of the guys I’ve been following for quite some time.
I was going to speak at this conference but I missed the speaker deadline because I was stupid. I will instead speak at Freedomfest next year, as well as have an entire booth at the trade show, right alongside guys like Peter Schiff. Pink Firefly will run the booth with the help of a few of my other friends. That will be fun, but that’s next year. This year it’s just me and my son attending and checking everything out, with my [Alpha 2.0 Business Seminar](http://www.blackdragonblog.com/2018/04/16/join-me-for-business-seminars-in-las-vegas/) afterwards.
One of my goals for this conference was to meet certain people. I made a list of everyone I wanted to talk to and I’m happy to report that I was able to spend some one-on-one time with everyone on that list. These men were various men I’ve mentioned on this blog before:
**Jim Rogers** – One of my all-time mentors, Guinness Book of World Records holder (he drive round the entire planet on a motorcycle) and one of the most successful self-made investors of all time. He flew all the way here from his home in Singapore (he wisely left the Collapsing West several years ago) and was very jetlagged when we talked the first time. Kinda funny.
**Doug Casey** – Another super successful business owner and investor who has helped me make a lot of money. He’s a total anarchist and very abrasive in his books and speeches (in a good way; I love guys like this), but was extremely pleasant and relaxed when I talked to him about his daily and weekly work habits.
**Peter Schiff** – The contrarian investor who called the crash of 2008 when most everyone else said everything was fine. I was only able to talk to him for a few minutes; a very hyper and high-energy guy. Fun.
**Jeff Berwick** – Big time anarchist who’s all over the internet and hosts another large annual freedom conference called Anarchapulco. I don’t agree with 100% of his views but I really like him and will probably be doing business with him soon.
There were some other guys here I liked and saw speak but didn’t necessarily need to meet, such as **Robert Kyosaki**, **Judge Andrew Napolitano**, **Steve Forbes** (yes, there are some Republicans here unfortunately, but Steve Forbes isn’t too bad), **Nick Gillespie**, **Gary Johnson**, **Andrew Puzder** (holy shit, this guy is amazing), **John Mackey, Adam Kokesh** and a few others. **John Stossel** was going to be here but had to cancel his appearance because he broke his jaw while playing volleyball(!).
Here are a few quotes and snippets from my conference notes that I thought were of interest:

*   如果明天所有的汽车都变成电动的，全球石油消耗总量只会下降 20%。

*   金库服务(像国际黄金金库)不被视为金融机构，所以他们没有报告要求，FATCA 不适用于他们。).

*   他们问世界各地的人们为什么不和更多的美国人做生意。答案是“你们美国人带着 5000 页的员工手册、5000 页的环境影响规则、5000 页的贸易规则等等出现，而中国人带着一个装满数亿美元的手提箱出现，说，‘我们准备好从周一开始。’“中国赢了。我们为什么要和你们美国人做生意？

*   吉姆·罗杰:“如果你一生中只能投资 20 件事情，你会怎么做？你会在投资前做大量的研究，而且你只会投资有把握的东西。”

*   罗伯特·清崎:“你的 FICO 分数屁用都没有。”

*   应该有 1000 个列支敦士登，而不是欧盟。

*   政府应该像邮局一样。你不在乎谁负责邮局，你只想让你的信到达那里。

*   一个常见的左翼观点是，美国的实际工资一直停滞不前，而员工生产率却在提高；因此，企业正在剥削员工。这是事实，但只是从 2004 年开始。自 2004 年以来，美国的整体生产率已经下降，并且还在继续下降。所以现在工资停滞不前*和*生产力下降。

*   罗伯特·清崎:“学生贷款现在是美国联邦政府的头号资产，达到 1.2 万亿美元。政府正在用这些无用的大学学位敲诈我们的学生。”

*   为了遵守所有政府法规，雇主每年平均在每个员工身上花费 10，000 美元。如果你是制造商，它是 20K 美元。如果你是一个小制造商，它是 30K 美元。中国没有扼杀我们的制造业就业机会；我们自己的政府做到了。

*   美国房屋所有权现在处于 60 年来的最低点。

*   无论何时投资，问问自己，“如果我错了呢？”然后从这个角度评估你的投资组合。你越相信自己是对的，你就越有可能错。永远，永远疯狂的多元化。

Anyway, Freedomfest has been fantastic, and attendance grows every year. Starting next year (the next Freedomfest is in Las Vegas next year, July 17-20^(th)), I will now be a part of this conference every year as a speaker and exhibitor. America is still fucked and libertarianism will never catch on, but the economic and investing data I’ve received, as well as the contacts I’ve made here is more than worth my time to attend and support this conference.
Can’t wait for next year!
