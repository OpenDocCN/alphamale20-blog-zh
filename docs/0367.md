# 失去焦点

关于李·艾柯卡，有一件非常有趣的事情是大多数人不知道或者不记得的。如果你不知道李·艾柯卡是谁(如果你不知道，你应该为自己缺乏商业知识而感到羞耻！)，他是历史上最著名的首席执行官之一，也是在 80 年代末扭转克莱斯勒濒临破产局面的商业远见者。与今天管理层解雇数千名一线员工的转变不同，艾科卡从问题通常出现的高层开始，并亲自解雇了公司 35 名最高副总裁中的 33 名。他还做了很多其他的事情，你可以在这里[阅读细节](http://www.dragoncollege.edu.au/blog/2011/how-lee-iacocca-resurrected-chrysler-and-its-lessons-for-us/)，但关键是他在短短几年内将一家几乎倒闭的公司变成了世界顶级汽车公司之一。这真的很神奇，他绝对是你可以学习的人。我当然有。然而，这个故事还有第二部分是大多数人不知道的。一旦克莱斯勒重回巅峰，艾科卡不再忙于解决克莱斯勒的大问题，他开始失去注意力。他开始挣扎。当他专注时，他促成了商业史上最伟大的转变之一。但是当事情终于进展顺利的时候，他开始做一些非常奇怪的事情。当他还是首席执行官的时候，他没有专注于他的事业， 他做过的事情有:

*   In charge of the innovation of the Statue of Liberty.

*   Joined the Congressional Budget Reduction Committee.

*   Wrote two books.

*   Started a newspaper syndicate column.

*   I bought an Italian villa and started bottling my own wine.

*   Bought a Gulfstream jet company.

*   Going into business again. Iacocca is a smart guy and a legendary businessman. Why did he do all this? Because he lost his attention. He may be the kind of person who excels under pressure and deadlines, but when the pressure disappears, he will become weak. Or maybe he's not like that at all, he just lost his advantage. It happened. I can understand. On several occasions, I worked very hard for several months on a very important project, problem or goal, and it was very productive. As soon as the project was completed or the problem was solved, suddenly my motivation was gone and I started to follow the crowd. My productivity and results were affected until I found a "reason" to act again. Besides, all normal things in life will keep attracting your attention. No wonder it's easy to lose attention like this. There are two ways to make sure this doesn't happen to you. 1\. After the current goal, always have a second goal or project *. One goal or one big project is never enough. You need multi-level goals or projects that you think are important. In this way, you will never lose your focus or advantage. Once your current goal or project is completed, you can celebrate it, take a few days off, pat yourself on the back, and then throw yourself into your next project/goal and start working on Monday morning. 2\. Make sure that any "big" project/goal you are working on is part of a larger whole, not the whole itself. Too many workaholics think that their work is everything. In the long run, this is not a way to win. For a while, you will be fine, but eventually you will hit a wall and you will realize that you should focus on other areas besides the current project. This is the meaning of having a mission in life. The task is not the goal. A goal is a simple thing that starts and ends. A task is ongoing, preferably forever. The shortest time range in the task (if any! ) is 20 years. Work for a project* or *to achieve a goal* , and you may become inattentive or depressed after completion. Strive to accomplish a real mission in life, this goal is only a small part of it, and it will never happen. Don't be like Iacocca. Okay, wait. Be like Iacocca, but make sure you are like him and stay focused, which is part of a larger whole. You will have a better life.
