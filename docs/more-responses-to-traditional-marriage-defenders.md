# 对传统婚姻捍卫者的更多回应

> 原文：<https://alphamale20.com/2018/11/01/more-responses-to-traditional-marriage-defenders/>

Several of you notified me of [this Huffington Post article](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/36-things-i-know-after-36_b_6321032) written by a married woman titled “36 Things I Know After 36 Years of Marriage.” Let’s examine what she says based on facts and reality instead of feels. This should be fun.

> 1.如果你认为和别人结婚会容易得多，那你可能错了。

If you’re talking about [TMM](https://blackdragonblog.com/glossary/#TMM), traditional monogamous marriage, where there is no legal separation of finances and absolute and forever sexual monogamy is expected by both partners, then yes, that’s right, the marriage won’t be easy with anyone else since humans were never designed to function that way for longer than about 2-3 years. Any time you attempt do so something diametrically opposed to your core biology, it’s going to be very hard no matter what you do. (Try not going to the bathroom at all for 24 hours and you’ll see what I mean.) It doesn’t matter which other human you attempt it with. Now, if you’re talking about a type of long-term pair-bonding that is much more congruent towards actual human biology (like [OLTR Marriage](https://blackdragonblog.com/glossary/#OLTR_marriage)), then no, it actually does make a difference regarding who you pair-bond with. If I had married a [Dominant](https://blackdragonblog.com/2012/07/29/the-three-types-of-women/), high-drama bitch instead of a happy sweetheart like Pink Firefly, my marriage would be extremely hard.

> 2.大多数婚姻问题都是可以解决的。真的。即使是强硬的。

Incorrect. If your husband really wants to fuck someone else, that’s not “fixable.” Biology again. Ether you need to go let him get some pussy on the side (which I’m sure you won’t allow), or he’ll grit his teeth and suffer for the rest of his life (and then eventually and statistically cheat on you behind your back). Not fixable, unless you completely redefine what is allowed in your marriage (which means it isn’t traditional nor monogamous anymore). As a matter of fact, *the really tough problems are often the ones that have no fix.* The fixable problems in a marriage are almost always the little things, like who sits where at the dining room table.

> 3.离婚是一种危险的武器。我建议用 F 字代替:失意。如果你说，“我沮丧得都要尖叫了”，没有人会心碎

Disagree completely. Both parties need to know that the other person can and will end the marriage if happiness can’t be achieved. Otherwise, the other person has zero motivation to play nice. **A woman is pleasant and sexual to the degree to which she knows you can and will leave her.** This applies to men as well, so I’m being fair here.

> 4.“婚姻幸福”这个词应该从每对夫妇的词汇中删除。婚姻在很多方面都是美好的，但是当婚姻只是交易的一部分时，期待幸福会让不可避免的艰难时刻看起来像是一个问题。

Obviously I agree. But if your marriage is hard, particularly over a prolonged period of time, then you’re with the wrong person and need to get divorced immediately. (Then ask yourself some very hard questions about why you were so wrong about picking that person as a long-term partner. Remember, [everything in your life is your fault](https://blackdragonblog.com/2015/01/04/everything-life-fault/).)

> 5.你的伴侣不会改变:错了。我和我丈夫是在 20 出头的时候认识的。如果我们都保持现状，我们仍然是两个天真的孩子，固执地坚持我们必须有自己的方式，认为婚姻不应该像现在这样具有挑战性。

People don’t change… but the exception to that is that people *can* change if given many decades.  I believe you when you say your husband has changed over the last 36 years. 36 years is a very long time. That’s older than many guys reading these words have been alive. The problem is when people get married expecting the other person to change *soon*, like as soon as they move in or as soon as a baby comes or whatever. Sorry, dumbass. They won’t. They either won’t change ever (in any large way), or will change but it will take 30 or 40 friggin’ years. The problem is that statistically your marriage won’t last that long, making this entire argument moot.

> 6.婚姻不会自己变好或保持好。

Factually incorrect. If it’s a traditional, monogamous marriage, at around the three year-mark, the marriage will (statistically) start getting worse, even if just a little, all on its own, even if you’re doing everything right and you’re the perfect spouse. Biology again. Sorry. If you don't believe me just try it and you'll see. Move in with a woman in a monogamous relationship (legally married or not isn't relevant), and wait at least three years. You'll be surprised at what happens. But I won't.

> 7.我们每个人都以自己的方式难以相处。开始解决你自己的一个问题行为，会对你的婚姻质量产生很大的影响。额外收获:你的配偶会非常感激！

Correct. (Seven items in and we *finally* found one that’s actually accurate to the real world. Let’s see how the rest go…) I’m certainly not easy to live with and I even warned Pink Firefly about this prior to her moving in. (She is easier to live with than me.) Much of this kind of conflict can be avoided by certain living logistics, like having separate blankets in bed, separate bathrooms, separate closets, even separate kitchens (I’m still working on that last one).

> 8.婚姻不幸福的人有时会认为婚姻是问题所在——认为婚姻不自然、过时或不可能做好。没有第三种实体叫做婚姻。你们之间发生的一切都是你的创造。你们每个人都扮演好自己的角色。为什么不创造一些有价值的东西呢？

Absolutely meaningless Disney horseshit. Yes, there is indeed a third entity called “marriage” that was invented by authoritarian Christians during the Dark Ages. And yes, it is the problem.

> 9.婚姻是一个“边工作边学习”的命题。我们中没有人具备成功所需的所有技能。当生活变得艰难时，这通常是我们需要一些新技能的信号，而不是我们需要一个新配偶的信号。

True. But there are times you *do* need a new spouse. That was certainly the case the first time I was married; I was a young idiot and married someone I was not compatible with, under a structure that was never designed to work long-term (traditional, monogamous marriage). There are also times where you shouldn’t be married *at all*. There are indeed some men and women who should never live with another human in a romantic context, ever.

> 10.婚姻中的斗争不仅不可避免，而且是必要的。如果不去面对和解决困难的问题，我们任何人都无法建立牢固健康的关系。

Partially true. This only applies to the initial first few months, perhaps year or so, when you’re still getting accustomed to A) living with another human being if you’ve never done it before and B) living with someone you’re in love with, sexual with, and with whom you’ve made commitments, which is very different than living with a roommate. After this adjustment phase, there is never a “need” for “difficult times.” That’s Disney bullshit again. Problems in a relationship don’t make you stronger. They just piss you off.

> 11.再好的婚姻也无法弥补我们成长过程中所面临的困难。我们都有童年创伤。当你内心不稳定的时候，认为你的配偶能让你感到安全和有保障是过分的要求。你越早(更有效地)处理你的“东西”，你的婚姻就会越健康，越令人满意。

Very true. Perhaps the truest thing she’s said.

> 12.爱从我们共同面对和克服的挑战中成长，也从我们分享的快乐中成长。

This is a partial repeat of number ten and it’s total bullshit. Drama and problems in a serious relationship do not make love grow. They actually damage both love and trust.

> 13.婚姻是关于两个人如何经营的漫长谈判。钱。亲密关系。为人父母。家务杂事。你可以战斗，也可以合作。合作回报更大。

No, it’s not a long negotiation; it’s a very short one. Again, the negotiation only needs to take place during the initial phase of the live-in portion of the relationship. That’s it. If you’re still arguing/negotiating with your spouse about chores after you’ve been living together for four years, then you’re both either idiots or drama queens.

> 14.即使是我们当中最顽固的人也能学会屈服。相信我这一次。

Correct, that’s why Alpha Males who go monogamous become beta males after a few years. I’ve seen it happen scores of times, including with my own father. She thinks this is a good thing. It’s actually a dreadful thing, and one of the biggest causes of divorce and marital unhappiness.

> 15.你配偶的大部分烦恼和挫折都与你无关——但有些是。你越早搞清楚哪个是哪个，你就会过得越好。

True.

> 16.在困难时期，承诺可能是你的可取之处。事实上，很久以前，你说“直到死亡将我们分开”，这可能是你坚持下去的唯一原因。这就足够了。

That only applies to pussies, beta males, and high-drama men. I love Pink Firefly more than I have ever loved a woman, and I want to stay with her the rest of my life, and I’ve made some commitments to her, but if she ever strikes me physically in anger, or if she ever demands I stop having sex with other women, or if she ever demands I work less hours or compromise on my Mission in any way, then, poof! Our marriage is over, perhaps immediately. It doesn’t matter how much I love her nor what my long-term objectives for the relationship were or are. My goal is long-term consistent happiness, not to be chained to a shitty or even mediocre marriage for the rest of my life. The goal is not to be married forever. The goal is to be married as long as possible (*possibly* forever) *while you’re both still happy.*

> 17.婚姻可以让你成为一个更好的人，也可以让你成为一个更坏的人。这是你的选择。

True. Just remember that TMM isn’t compatible with human biology, regardless of your intentions.

> 18.抱怨和批评与要求改变不是一回事。

If you want to be long-term happy in a marriage, you’ve got two choices: 1\. If you dislike something regarding the other person and it’s causing a real problem, come to that person in a calm tone of voice and in the spirit of collaboration between two mature adults and work it out, knowing you may not get 100% of what you want and accepting that as best you can. or 2\. Suck it up and keep your fucking complaints to yourself. Complaining is unacceptable. So are demands for the other person to change.

> 19.沮丧是婚姻的最大威胁之一。我见过挣扎中的夫妇放弃婚姻，如果给他们适当的指导和鼓励，让他们坚持下去，解决问题，他们的婚姻很可能会得救。

I agree in general, but again, the goal is not to maintain a shitty or mediocre marriage. **Maintaining a marriage is not the objective. Happiness is.**

> 20.想到你有 50%的机会离婚，这看起来就像抛硬币。不是的。有些行为几乎注定会失败。我们都知道它们是什么。不做是个好主意。

Incorrect! You can not control the actions, behaviors, and desires of the other person. You can only control yourself (and even that is difficult). So even if you are the perfect spouse forever (and you’re not and you won’t be), your odds of divorce are still sky-high, because you’re reliant on that other person, whom you can’t control, to play nice for the next 50+ years straight. Good fucking luck.

> 21.友善有帮助。

I think she’s running out of ideas to make her list of 36 items.

> 22.说谢谢也一样。

Confirmed, she’s running out of ideas.

> 23.我对自己的生活越开心，我就越不会对我丈夫令人恼火的行为感到恼火。

Very true. **That is exactly why happiness must always be the goal.** If you have a great marriage to a great woman and you still dislike your life, your marriage won’t work. If you’re the perfect husband in every way but married to a woman who is unhappy with the rest of her life, your marriage won’t work. **HAPPINESS FIRST. MARRIAGE SECOND.** Societal Programming teaches the opposite.

> 24.一段美好的婚姻会有冲突、挫折、无聊、无法解决的争论、摔门和一个人睡在沙发上的夜晚。关键是要有足够多的好东西来平衡它们。

Wrong. A marriage that involves these things on a regular basis is not a good marriage and should be terminated immediately. Now, yes, everyone can have a bad day *every once in a while*. If your wife is a bitch two or three times a year, then okay, fine, be a man and suck it up. You can be a dick sometimes too. But if she’s a bitch all the time? No. Time to end it.

> 25.敞开心扉并不总是容易的。

Very true. I’ve had this problem myself. Even tough, asshole INTJs need to chill out sometimes and just feel.

> 26.爱情很重要。虽然爱不能治愈一切，即使(尤其是)在困难时期，但爱是一块试金石，提醒你当初为什么要在一起。

More Disney BS. Love is not the answer. Happiness is. Nothing justifies unhappiness, *including* *love*. More than once in my life have I had to end a relationship with someone I loved because she was not making me happy. **HAPPINESS FIRST. MARRIAGE SECOND.**

> 27.婚姻不是孤独的解药。虽然婚姻提供了友谊，但亲密和联系并不是永恒的。有时候我们是同步的。有时候我们不是。在需要的时候能够抚慰和安慰自己是很重要的。

Correct. Everyone must first have the ability to be alone and *be happy while alone* before attempting any serious, long-term, live-in relationship. I talk about this in [my primary book](http://www.alphamalebook.com).

> 28.年复一年，当你和同一个人在一起时，很容易陷入一种固定模式。做爱。假期。晚餐。你如何度过星期六晚上。改变事情。加点香料。

**THAT’S EXACTLY WHY YOUR MARRIAGE SHOULD NOT BE MONOGAMOUS.** I get all the “spice” I want in my marriage; it’s called having three or four hot, young [FBs](https://blackdragonblog.com/glossary/#FB) on the side at all times. It works great. **I am 100% convinced that if all marriages allowed both parties to go get a little discreet, condomed, meaningless but enjoyable sex on the side when needed, the overall divorce rate would go *down,* not up.** Too bad society is too needy and stuck up their own asses to give it a try on a mass scale. Oh well. Not that I care.

> 29.大多数好的婚姻都有一个人扮演着关系“守护者”的角色:提出困难话题的人。在困难时期保持希望的人。当你们中的一方或双方变得激动时，作为稳定影响力的人。在一个理想的世界里，这一角色应该是共享的。在现实世界中，只需要一个。

Yeah, this is more or less true in most marriages, including mine (I am this person).

> 30.在战斗中最好的方法之一就是停止战斗。休息一下。冷静下来。过会儿回来。急性子是糟糕的问题解决者。

Correct, very much so. The problem is this is very hard to do for most women and Alpha Male 1.0s, both of whom have a tendency towards drama instead of away from it.

> 31.有些冲突不能通过妥协来解决。(我们不能生半个孩子，也不能买半个度假屋)。当不存在“折中”这种事情时，解决方案就变成了慷慨的问题，一个人对他们的第二个选择说“是”，另一个人承认这是一个礼物。

This is accurate. Now here’s how to handle it: When the issue is a small one (where you have dinner that night), then just give it to her and move on. Who gives a fuck? Focus on the big things, not the little ones. You’ll be a happier man that way. When the issue is a large one (“Stop having sex with other women!”), stand your ground. Be nice, be flexible, but never give in. Example: “I’m always going to have sex with other women, for the rest of my life, period, end of story, and if that’s going to make you really angry, you need to divorce me immediately because this isn’t going to work. But that being said, I love you and I’m willing to be flexible about this and work with you on it. Is there anything I can do regarding sex on the side that would make you more comfortable?”

> 32.打架从来都不是为了内容。我们把洗碗精存放在哪里，走临街道路或高速公路是否更快，不回短信是否非常不礼貌——这些都不值得我们紧张。我们的烦恼是关于我们对那些没有得到回应的文本所做的更大的理解，对影响力的抗拒，拒绝认真对待我们所要求的事情。准确地说出是什么让你生气真的很有帮助。

Absolutely correct. It’s up to YOU to be outcome independent so these things won’t bother you. Read [my book](http://www.alphamalebook.com/) on how to do this.

> 33.幸福的婚姻和从此幸福的生活有很大的不同。我们没有一个人是全天候快乐的。谢天谢地，我们不需要这样。

I already addressed this above. Unusual, reasonably rare unhappiness in a marriage is fine. Regular unhappiness in a marriage is unacceptable and you should just get divorced if that problem can’t be resolved.

> 34.当你心里想，我真的不应该这么说，你可能是对的。

Correct. This is particularly true for blunt, outcome independent Alpha Male 2.0 types like yours truly.

> 35.学习如何化妆是很重要的，因为你们永远都不会到一个你们都不会搞砸的地步。

Okay, but the goal is to not have to make up very often because drama or conflict in your marriage is so rare.

> 36.你们中的一个必须先走。先道歉。先脆弱起来。先让步。先原谅。为什么不让那个人成为你呢？

I generally agree. If you’re at fault (and many times you will be), apologize and do so quickly. If you’re not at fault but the issue is a minor one (and almost always it will be), just blow it off and move on. Real arguments should be saved for big, giant, important issues, which again, should be very, very rare. So on the overall, she had a *few* accurate observations mixed in with a shitload of Disney bullshit and “drama is healthy / being unhappy a lot is okay” Societal Programming. About what I expected.
