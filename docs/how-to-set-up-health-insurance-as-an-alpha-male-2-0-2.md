**美国人的阿尔法男性 2.0 医疗保健计划:**

1.  Stop making those bullshit excuses and raise your fucking income so that you can pay for most of the "normal" medical expenses yourself, instead of having to rely on your corrupt and collapsed government or your ripped-off corporatist medical insurance group. When the western world is on the verge of collapse, relying on the government or large medical insurance companies to take care of you for a long time is the stupidest thing you can do.

2.  Get a *catastrophic* health care plan, which has a lower monthly premium but will take care of you when you encounter terrible and expensive health care problems (such as cancer or arm amputation).

3.  Get an HSA account attached to a debit card. Deposit as much as possible into that account every year (up to $3,500) so that you can deduct it from your taxes.

5.  Use your HSA to pay for your doctor's visit.

**生活在社会主义国家的非美国人的阿尔法男性 2.0 医疗保健计划:**

1.  Recognizing that every country is different, I can't cover everything, so I am forced to generalize. Stop making those bullshit excuses and increase your fucking income until you can pay most of the "normal" medical expenses instead of having to rely on your corrupt, socialist and collapsing government. When the western world is on the verge of collapse, relying on your government and its bankrupt medical system to take care of you for a long time is the stupidest thing you can do. Set aside a sum of money so that you can pay your own medical expenses in case your stupid government can't or won't pay. Besides, set aside some cash, so that if your country can't or won't provide medical services, you can go to another country for treatment.

基本上就是这样。这里的要点是不要依赖一些外部实体，特别是一个崩溃的西方政府或一个残酷的，没有灵魂的医疗保健公司来长期照顾你的健康。
