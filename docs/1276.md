> The worst thing about being a kid is that no one told me the truth about my situation. In fact, they did the exact opposite, and of course I believed them, because I was just a kid and didn't know any better. I mean, Christ, my brain hadn't even grown to full size yet. So how could I be expected to know when adults were bullshitting me?

One of the common threads that link all of my content; women, dating, relationships, business, finance, lifestyle, is that you must consciously resist all the bullshit that society has filled your brain with since the day you were born. [My primary book](http://www.alphamalebook.com) talks about how to do this in great detail, as have numerous articles at my blogs over the past 10 years. One of the barriers to doing this is that, amazingly, *you may not want to let your false Societal Programming go.* I’m quite serious. There are times you’re going to *want* to keep believing in bullshit. As strange as it sounds, believing in bullshit is usually more comforting than acknowledging unpleasant but objective reality. Think about it… Thinking that somewhere out there, in your city, lies that perfect, cute [Unicorn Woman](https://blackdragonblog.com/2015/08/31/mens-great-flaw-looking-for-the-unicorn-woman/), that girl who is Not Like The Rest™, who is a perfect virgin Christian who, if you find her, will marry you and never cheat on you and never get fat and never divorce you and always give you blowjobs and clean your house forever.
It’s a nice thought. You don’t want to throw that fantasy away! It gives you some level of peace to believe in this bullshit.
Thinking that, if you just get enough people to vote for him, Bernie Sanders (or one of his heirs) will provide you with free food and free college and free health care and will tax those Evil Rich People™ and make them mad and all of that will work forever…
It’s a really nice thought (at least for some, not for me.) Thinking that Donald Trump will singlehandedly time-warp all of America back to the [1950s when everything was perfect](https://blackdragonblog.com/2015/10/12/freedom-and-happiness-or-an-orderly-society/), build a wall, kick out all those God Damn Immigrants™, totally reform government and the news media, and beat the shit out of those SJWs so you can jump up and down with some orgasmic glee… Yeah, it’s a really nice thought (again, for some people, not for me).
Thinking that, if you just do what your mom/dad/best friend told you to do, that if you just go to college, major in STEM, get a Good Job™, then everything will be perfectly fine because you’re a good guy and you mean well and you're a hard worker and you want to make your parents proud…
Yeah man, these bullshit thoughts are very compelling. I don’t have any of these thoughts, since I cleaned out my SP about 15 years ago, but I fully understand how peaceful, alluring, comforting, and pleasant these bullshit thoughts could be.
If you’re experiencing these thoughts and some big asshole like me comes along and shows you via actual facts and studies that long-term monogamy doesn’t work, that college is a waste of your time, that no politician will be able to save the West, or that getting a job will just end up bankrupting you in the long-term, you’re going to get upset with me ***even if on some level you know or suspect the thoughts you’re defending probably aren’t true.***
It’s *hard* to believe in the truth. It’s *hard* to [admit that 2+2=4](https://blackdragonblog.com/2013/11/24/2-2-5/). Objectivity and rationality are *hard*. That’s why these things are so rare with human beings.
How do you force yourself to believe in reality then?
That's a very complicated question with several answers, but here's the easiest one: you have to get mad at yourself.
You have to look at your life and get upset. You have to get to the point where you look at yourself in the mirror and scream “NO MORE!” Note that I said you have to get mad at **yourself**, since [everything in your life is your fault](https://blackdragonblog.com/2015/01/04/everything-life-fault/). Getting mad at anyone external to yourself is just a waste of your time. But getting mad at yourself, to the point where you want to make a change, ah, that’s very healthy.
It’s at that point you might have enough balls to submit to objective reality instead of the bullshit SP your mom or YouTube is peddling you.
I reached that point many years ago. I knew that believing in the bullshit would not make my life better. I knew that I had to admit how reality and human beings actually worked in the real world even if I hated it.
It was hard to do. But I got over it once my life started getting amazing. Once I started making more money, doing more enjoyable things, having sex with more women (and more attractive women), over time I stopped giving a shit about the comfort my bullshit SP was giving me. More and more I desired more objective reality. Every day I started asking myself these two questions:
1\. How do human beings actually work in the real world?
2\. How can I exploit this behavior to get what I want without having to lie, hurt anyone, or break the law?
The more I answered those two questions, the more money I made, the more sex I got, the better my life became, and the happier I was.
Often I hated the answer to question number one. I thought the answer was unfair, sometimes even insane. But the answer was the answer. So, no matter how much I hated it, instead of fighting it, I forced myself to move to question number two.
Once I implemented the answer to question number two, my life improved, often by amazing leaps and bounds.
I kept doing this, over and over again.
And today, I’m the happiest man I know. My life is so amazing that to this very day, I still can’t believe I get to do the things I do every day. I’m very serious about this. It’s been over 10 years and there are days I still can’t believe it.
So it’s well worth letting your thumb-suck blanket, your bullshit Societal Programming, go.
You just have to make the decision to be happy.
