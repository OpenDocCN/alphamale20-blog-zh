# 专注的工作与正常的工作

典型工作日中只有大约 40%的时间是在工作。另外 60%(至少！)就是浪费时间。有些浪费的时间是你的错，有些是你的工作环境的错，有些是你的老板或管理层的错。工作中浪费时间的例子都是你的错:

*   Websites unrelated to work. Facebook, online shopping, sports, blogs, whatever. [64% of employees visit websites](http://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylsnappconner/2012/07/17/employees-really-do-waste-time-at-work/) **unrelated to work every day. That's every day!**
*   Pornography. 25% of employees admit to watching porn at work.
*   Find another job.
*   Watch TV or other videos (YouTube, Hulu, Netflix, etc.).
*   Personal phone calls and text messages.
*   Personal mailbox. Small talk-chatting with colleagues about gossip, sports or other things unrelated to work.

因工作环境而浪费工作时间的例子:

*   Spam and other useless e-mails. Interrupted by colleagues, employees and bosses. Poor written or oral communication from colleagues.
*   Fix the mistakes of colleagues.

*   Office politics.

工作中浪费时间是老板的错的例子:

*   Useless meeting.
*   Useless conference call.
*   Give useless training on topics that you will never use at work.
*   Inefficient workflow system.
*   Slow or problematic computers that have not been upgraded or repaired. Most people report that they waste about 25% of their time at work. But in actual research, [the more accurate figure is 60% to 80%](http://www.k-state.edu/media/newsreleases/jan13/cyberloaf13113.html) . Based on my business experience, I would say this is true, although some people are obviously worse than others. If 60% to 80% of your working time is wasted, it means that if you spend 1 hour working very hard on a specific, productive and important task, *and* stick to it completely, *and* won't wander around, *and* won't be *by anyone* Think about it. This means that theoretically you can work 50 hours a week, then turn it into 15 hours, and still get the same amount of work done. That's why I can run three companies at the same time, but most of the time I work less than 30 hours a week. When I'm working, I will set a timer for one hour, turn off my phone and put it away, close my email program, and devote myself to a *dedicated* hour of work. No distractions, no fooling around, no messing up paperwork or meetings or other stupid things. Only one hour's full-time work. My whole working life revolves around *focused* working hours, instead of *normal* working hours. I have to finish more work in a shorter time than anyone I know. If you start doing the same thing, you can and will change your work life.
