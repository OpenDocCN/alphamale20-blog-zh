# 如何在经济衰退期间作为一个阿尔法男性 2.0 赚钱

(注:术语“衰退”是指 GDP 连续两个季度(六个月)下降。因此，从技术上讲，我们还没有陷入衰退，直到 8 月初才会知道我们是否处于衰退，尽管这种情况发生的可能性很大，即使冠状病毒到那时还不是一个大问题。不管怎样，我将在这里使用术语“衰退”来表示简单的语言。我们显然正处于 一 急剧的经济衰退之中。)

If you consider just my adult life, this is my fourth recession. My first was the downsizing recession of the early 1990s, then the Dot-Com Bubble and 9/11 Crash of 2000/2001, then the Great Recession of 2008\. Even these recessions do not include the ones that happened when I was a child, since I was born in 1972\. These would include the Oil Crisis during the 1970s and the horrible double-dip recession of the early 1980s.  The bottom line is that **recessions are normal**. You can pretty much assume a recession is going to come along and smack you in the head every ten years or so. Recessions are also good, as I explain [here](https://calebjonesblog.com/its-not-capitalism-its-corporatism/). They are a valuable cleansing process. They clean the market by removing the scammers, idiots, people who got lucky, and incompetent business owners (as well as many incompetent employees). It removes capital from those who should not have it and moves it to more competent stewards. When the recession is over, most people left standing in the business world are the competent ones who can carry things forward more effectively. The exceptions to this are the corrupt or incompetent companies and business owners who are bailed out by big government, such as banks and airlines. But there’s not much we can do about that since we Americans live in a corporatist country. 

在 经济衰退期间赚钱 作为一个小企业主，赚钱和在其他时候有点不同。在正常时期，一旦你的企业运营到一定水平，为了维持一份体面的收入，没有什么不寻常或不寻常的事情是必需的。在真正的繁荣时期，即使是蹩脚的企业主在某些条件下也能赚到相当多的钱。

在经济衰退期间，这些都不是真的。在这些时候，企业主需要发挥创造力，更加努力地工作。否则，他们会失去他们的生意，不得不回去找狗屁公司工作。(呸！)

幸运的是，阿尔法男性 2.0 并不像大多数企业主那样受到衰退的影响，原因如下:

1\. He is selling *high-margin* products, services, or information, meaning he doesn’t need as many customers nor does he need to sell as much volume in order to stay in business as compared to normal business owners. 2\. He sells to a *narrow, motivated niche* instead of to a large market, thus he’s more likely to continue to make sales even when times are tighter. 3\. He has *multiple businesses* selling to multiple, diversified markets, so if one business doesn’t do well, one of his others are probably doing fine. 4\. He has *multiple income streams* from each business, so if certain streams are damaged, other ones continue. 5\. He’s *location independent*, so he can quickly switch from problematic locations to better ones with relative ease. He can also retarget his marketing efforts from one market segment to another if needed, sometimes almost instantly.

像往常一样，成为一名 Alpha 2.0 企业主要比成为一名普通的企业主好得多，但这一点我之前已经说过很多次了。不管怎样，Alpha 2.0 企业主仍然会受到经济衰退的负面影响，至少是一点点。这意味着，如果他想安然度过衰退，一旦市场反弹(通常如此)，他需要修改他的方法。

以下是阿尔法男性 2.0 企业主在经济衰退期间必须做的事情，以确保他的收入保持不变或增加:

**1\. He needs to work harder****, at least somewhat****.** If you work the same hours as a business owner during a recession as during good times, then you’re likely asking for problems. Unless you’ve seen literally no dip in your income during the recession (which *is* possible if you own Alpha 2.0 businesses), you’ll need to increase your average weekly work hours.

在冠状病毒来袭的几周前，我实际上增加了我的工作时间，因为我为 2020 年设定了一些大的商业目标，所以我已经这样做了，但无论如何，由于这场衰退，我可能会这样做。

**2\. He needs to increase his marketing.** Whatever marketing you were doing during normal times needs to be increased. More marketing equals more sales. As I always say, marketing is the most important function in your company. If you don’t market, you’re screwed. If you don’t market in a recession, your days may be numbered.

有些人不喜欢做营销。艰难的狗屎。如果你不喜欢它，关闭你的业务，回去做一个员工的奴隶。营销是你为企业家提供的自由所付出的代价。此外，一旦你做了一段时间，它会变得有趣。当我年轻的时候，我曾经讨厌营销，但今天我真的很喜欢它。

有些人还担心他们的一些现有客户或观众会不喜欢他们收到的任何增加的营销。确实如此，他们中的一些人会讨厌它。没问题，他们可以随时离开，或许应该离开。如果你提供的是价值，这将只是很小的一部分，你将获得的新客户将会大大弥补这一点。我自己也经历过几次，我可以告诉你一个事实，它总是以这种方式工作，特别是如果你做下面这件事…

**3\. You need to refocus on added value.** You need to make what you offer even more valuable to your niches. How can your products, services, or information be even more valuable than they were before? How can your free content be more valuable? How can you add value? You need to brainstorm these questions, get some ideas, then implement them.

萧条中的欣欣向荣本质上就是这个公式: **多劳+** **多销+附加值** 。如果你这样做，你就赢了。我向你保证，你的绝大多数竞争对手 *都不会这么做。等到经济衰退结束时，这些家伙中的大多数都会破产。然后，除了在衰退期间获得的新客户，你还会获得他们的客户。*

你可以带着大量新资金离开衰退，也可以带着被摧毁的企业离开。选择是 你的。
